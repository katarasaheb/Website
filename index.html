  <!-- About Section -->
  <section id="about" class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Why hasn't the grocery industry evolved to meet the needs of modern consumers? The self-serve supermarket model, introduced in Canada over a century ago, remains largely unchanged. Despite technological advancements, grocery shopping is still costly, inefficient, and unsustainable. The Competition Bureau’s 2023 report outlines the pressing need for disruption in Canada’s grocery market. Kitchin is answering that call.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>A smarter, faster, and more sustainable grocery model powered by AI, automation, and dark stores—optimizing sourcing, fulfillment, and last-mile delivery. It's not just about speed; it’s about reimagining the entire farm-to-table journey.</p>
